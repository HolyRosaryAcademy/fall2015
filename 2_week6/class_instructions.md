# Instructions for Week 6 of Programming at Holy Rosary Academy, Spring 2016


## As I know some of you are interested in creating VIDEO GAMES, today I thought we'd take a look at a new resource from the BBC, the Dr. Who Game Creator.

1- to go [Dr. Who Game Maker](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/26Y2fJtHFZ2wWp397SHttGM/doctor-who-game-maker) and click on the "Make Games" button on the left

2- click on the "how to make a simple game" blue button on the lower left

3- experiment and have fun!
