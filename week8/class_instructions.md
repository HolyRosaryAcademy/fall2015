## Beginning Computer Science, Fall 2015: Week 8: Breaking Down a Javascript Loop

1- We'll analyze each part of the loop that we began experimenting with last week

2- We'll look at the difference between an open ended "While" loop, versus a "For" loop.

After trying on your own, you can try loading the loops I wrote here:
[JS Bin For Versus While Loops](https://jsbin.com/lebene/edit?js,console)

3- You can experiement with your own loops and print messages to the console.log here at [JS Bin](http://www.jsbin.com)

4- Continue the interactive exercises you worked on last week at [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-NhsaT/2/1?curriculum_id=502d635ceda910000200293b#!/exercises/0)
