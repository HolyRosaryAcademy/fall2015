# Instructions for April 27th, Programming at Holy Rosary Academy, Spring 2016


1- We're going to narrow down our Shroud project today, and work on examining the binary or source code behind the JPEG image, and see if we can apply some algorithms to find strings of 0s and 1s that we can translate into some kind of meaningful text.

Let's review our understanding of the word "algorithm"!

     a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end especially by a computer

2- You have 2 ways you can participate. 

###You can use [JSBIN](http://jsbin.com/qoyacu/edit?html,js,console)

###You can download the .js and .html files found in this week's [Github folder] (https://github.com/HolyRosaryAcademy/fall2015/tree/master/2_week9). With this option, you'll have to use your local Sublime Text Editor, and Google Chrome with the Developer Tools open to the Console.

3- I'll have different .txt files you can link to in the $.ajax data call you see near the top of this file. What we are looking for is the best way to cycle through this text data and strip it of everything other than 0s and 1s, saved in the correct order in which they appear.

4- After that we'll take a look at pasting sections of this code into online editors that convert it to different languages as well as plain text. One interesting such editor is [found here](https://paulschou.com/tools/xlate/).
