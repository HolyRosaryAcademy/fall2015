### Book for anybody serious about learning to program...

One thing every student in this class needs to understand: you will not learn to program by sitting in this class alone. There is simply not enough time. In addition, learning to program requires experimentation, trial and error, and more importantly, incentive.

The best thing you can do is find a subject you are actually interested in, and begin playing around with designing a simple web app (javascript app) that does something with this subject.

I can point you to samples, give you definitions and help you learn key programming concepts. But you will only begin to really become a programmer by learning on your own. Think of programming as a sport that really isn't much of a team sport. 

This is a free resource that any student who is serious about programming should begin using, in your own time. I will be available for questions and help any day after class.

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).  This is available online and in app stores if you want to use it on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet as well. I recommend reading it for at least 2 or 3 hours a week, and completing all interactive exercises as you do that.
