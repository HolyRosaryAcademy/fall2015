# Instructions for May 4th, Programming at Holy Rosary Academy, Spring 2016


1- Download the materials from last week on the Github website (week2_9) - and save them to a folder on your local hard drive.

2- Open up the shroud_algos.html file in Chrome, and open the resulting .json file in a text editor.

3- paste the code into this [binary to text app](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/)

4- Do you see any words? Bible references? Numbers that could have meaning?

5- Repeat the process above, adjusting the fileNumber variable on line number 11 in the shroud_algos.js file

    var fileNumber = '1';
	
### Adjust the '1' to '2', then '3', etc - until you reach the final file, '20'.
