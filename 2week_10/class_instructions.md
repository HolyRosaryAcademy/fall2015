# Instructions for May 4th, Programming at Holy Rosary Academy, Spring 2016


1- Download the shroud_app.zip file and unzip it to a folder on your hard drive. Don't unzip to the desktop - unzip this to a shroud_app or similar folder.

2- Open up the shroud_algos.html file in Chrome. Look through the code to see what is happening, then click on the green "run" button at the bottom right. 

3- paste the code from the output box or the .txt file into this [binary to text app](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/). You can also use the red button at the bottom of the shroud image parsing app to do that.

4- Do you see any words? Bible references? Numbers that could have meaning?

5- Repeat the process above, adjusting the fileNumber variable in the code part of the app.

    var fileNumber = '1';
	
### Adjust the '1' to '2', then '3', etc - until you reach the final file, '20'.

6- Experiment with changing the algorithm: right now the variables we are searching for are on line 48:

    value == '00' || value == '01' || value == '10' || value =='11'
		
Try changing these to different combinations of 0s and 1s. You can also add console statements wherever you'd like.

7- Use the reset button at the top right to reset your code and try something else.
