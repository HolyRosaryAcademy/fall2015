### Take Home Topic: Version Control


####Why Use Version Control?

- It provides one method for an entire team to use; everybody operates under the same 'ground rules'.
- Changes are orderly vs. chaotic, saving development time
- The ability to track changes promotes accountability and makes it easier to find the right persom to solve problems in the materials maintained.
- A list of exact changes made can be generated quickly and easily, making it easier to advise users of the information on how it has changed from version to version.
- It is easy to 'roll back' to an earlier version of the information, if a serious mistake was made during a change.
