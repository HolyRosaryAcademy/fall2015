# Instructions for April 6th, Programming at Holy Rosary Academy, Spring 2016


1- We are going to try our hand at a programming project related to the Shroud of Turin. For those of you who may not know a lot about the Shroud, one of the best write ups I've seen detailing the evidence for the Shroud is from 2001 - by Daniel Porter, former blogger from [Shroud Story](http://shroudstory.com). Dan's excellent piece is found here in PDF format. You may not have time to read the whole thing in class, but it is essential to understand what the Shroud may be, in order to fully participate in our Shroud project.

2- For the project, we'll divide once again into groups.  Here are the groups:

A- Converting the Shroud to Vector Art (SVG) Format
	1- Drew
	2- Richard
	3- Dominic
	4- Atlin
	
B- Researching current theories on messages embedded in the Shroud, and/or the 3-D information and its interpretation
	1- Matthew
	4- Stephen
	2- Michael
  3- Silas
	
C- Outlining what kind of SVG parsing algorithms we might be able to write in order to find out something new about the Shroud and its purpose or message for humanity
	1- Alec
	2- Forrest
	3- Eric
  4- Andrew
	
I have some definite ideas of what sources and questions each group should look at, but first I want  each group to devise a plan of attack on their own!! Here are issues your group should determine:

1- what websites and/or experts can help us in our search? Are there experts we can contact via email or phone who might share their data with us? What exact data would we request?

2- once we have some data about our topic, what else do we need to accomplish our task? For example, to convert from bitmap to vector - how could we do that? To search for hidden codes, is their a body of research we can already parse, or do we have to create our own data? For creating an SVG parser, would we help write code, or use something commercially available? 

This should get us started for the day!
