## Beginning Computer Science, Fall 2015: Week 6: Continuing with Arrays, Intro to Loops

1- We'll begin by doing 10 to 15 minutes of reading from our handout on the history of operating systems.

2- Then we'll have with 2 or 3 more presentations about the Computer Science topics assigned to students last week. My list is as follows:

- Silas: worst hacking episode the world has faced
- Drew: bluetooth: how does it work?
- Michael: fasted sorting algorithm
- Dominick: something related to the source of the Internet, how it works, where it comes from
- Richard: what is a bit?
- Matthew: what is an intel chip?
- Andrew:  world's most powerful computer
- Stephen: how do flight computers work in airplanes?
- Forrest: worst corporate fight in the video game industry
- Atlin: world's most expensive personal computer
- Alec: world's first personal computer
- Eric:  current role the miltary plays in the internet

2- We'll take a look at the homework, and discuss any questions or problems with completing the activity. We'll try doing this activity in a web programming "playground" - [Live Weave](http://liveweave.com/). 

3- For your images, you can find a few URLS to images here on [Google Images](http://www.google.com) = click on the IMAGES tab.

3- Use the handout on Arrays from the homework, and we'll build a quick display of images using Live Weave and the images you selected above.

4- If we have time, we'll complete a couple of activities on Arrays and Loops at [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-NhsaT/2/1?curriculum_id=502d635ceda910000200293b#!/exercises/0)
