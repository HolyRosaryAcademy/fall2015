## Beginning Computer Science, Fall 2015: Week 5: Intro to Arrays

1- We'll begin with a quick follow up about last week's reading, finishing up a few of the events in the timeline between the 50s and the present.

2- We'll move in with 2 or 3 presentations about the Computer Science topics assigned to students last week. My list is as follows:

- Silas: worst hacking episode the world has faced
- Drew: bluetooth: how does it work?
- Michael: fasted sorting algorithm
- Dominick: something related to the source of the Internet, how it works, where it comes from
- Richard: what is a bit?
- Matthew: what is an intel chip?
- Andrew:  world's most powerful computer
- Stephen: how do flight computers work in airplanes?
- Forrest: worst corporate fight in the video game industry
- Atlin: world's most expensive personal computer
- Alec: world's first personal computer
- Eric:  current role the miltary plays in the internet

2- We'll also look at the tutorial on arrays, found here:

3- If we have time, we'll complete this interactive exercise on arrays:
